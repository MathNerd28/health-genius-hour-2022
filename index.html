      <h2 class="centered text section-header">What makes social media so <b>addictive</b>?</h2>
      <p class="body text">
        Social media is designed specifically to keep people engaged with content. When you click or scroll through
        your feed, you may think you're just seeing the same things as other people around you. As a recent Netflix
        documentary "The Social Dilemma" reveals, this could not be farther from the truth.
      </p>

      <p class="body text">
        Companies engage massive computer networks that learn what you like, what you don't like, what you're likely
        to like, and anything else that will keep your attention for longer. They can measure how long you look at
        an image, how long it took you to read a comment, whether you doubled back for a second glance, and a
        hundred other things (Mustafa) that are fed into an AI computer model that probably knows you better than you
        know
        yourself. This information is used to hold your attention as long as possible, and also to show you as many
        advertisements as they can. As former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris states, "If you're not paying
        for the product, then you <i>are</i> the product."
      </p>

      <p class="body text">
        The term AI usually scares people, as they often picture futuristic fantasies such as Terminator or the
        Matrix. However, the age of AI is already here, as computer programs such as
        <a href="https://www.openai.com/"
           target="_blank">OpenAI's GPT-3</a>
        have learned to have meaningful conversations. The part
        that <i>should</i> scare you is how these programs learn much faster than humans possibly ever could, and
        have already surpassed our ability in certain tasks (e.g. deterministic games). This means that while the
        computers are already pretty good at ensuring people stay on their platforms for as long as possible, they
        will only continue to improve, and we are powerless to stop them from doing so.

      <h2 class="centered text section-header">What are the <b>privacy concerns</b>?</h2>

      <p class="body text">The usage of social media platforms may seem like a free service, but that
        couldn't
        be farther from the truth. Rather
        than paying with cash, people all across the globe give up their personal information to tech giants such as
        Meta,
        Twitter, Snap Inc., and ByteDance, to name a few. Primarily, Meta, previously Facebook, seems to be the
        driving
        force
        behind the changes in the current era of digital privacy. Few can remember a time when Facebook originally
        offered its
        users "simple and powerful controls over their personal information", as they've since changed their
        practices
        to drive
        their business and make money from (Anderson).

    <div id="mental-health"
         class="section">
      <h2 class="centered text section-header">How does social media impact <b>mental health</b>?</h2>

      <p class="body text">
        One in-depth study found a significant correlation between general unhappiness and social media addiction,
        although it
        does not specify which is the cause (Demir). However, the concept of mental health impact is largely based on
        self-comparison. Humans are social creatures, and we crave to be accepted by our society. As a result, we get a
        dopamine
        hit every time we see a like on our post, but it also means that any negative comments are soul-crushing.
      </p>

      <p class="body text">
        These unnatural endorphin levels can cause serious mood swings, or even more serious health problems such as
        depression
        or thoughts of suicide. In addition, you're constantly comparing yourself to a world of perfect lives and
        filters, which
        you can't possibly match, and this only adds to the negative feelings. Social media has many horrible impacts on
        the
        brain, especially for developing teens.

      <h2 class="centered text section-header">How is social media used for <b>manipulation</b>?</h2>

      <p class="body text">
        Social media companies can harness the power of AI to make you believe what they want you to believe, but they
        aren't
        the only ones in power. Often, social media is used as a political battlefield during major election campaigns
        in the
        United States, as well as other regions of the world (Kelly). As a prime example, previous US president Donald
        Trump was
        banned from multiple social media platforms (including Twitter, FaceBook and YouTube) after he was accused of
        inciting
        violence against the Capital building in Washington DC in 2021. Words written online have real-world
        ramifications,
        which can sometimes be abused for personal gain or harm.

    <div id="communication"
         class="section">
      <h2 class="centered text section-header">How does social media affect <b>communication</b>?</h2>

      <p class="body text">
        Speaking with a person online isn't the same as talking in person. In a book written by Penn State researcher Bu
        Zhong
        titled "Social Media Communication: Trends and Theories", he elaborates on how
        skills we use when meeting face-to-face aren't possible through a text interface, including most forms of body
        language
        and tone. In addition, he also states "People may ask more direct questions and disclose more information about
        themselves when communicating with a stranger through a computer than when interacting face to face" (Bohn).
        Styles and
        methods of getting information across drastically differ between a screen and a face, which forces us to
        compensate by
        clarifying more often than we normally would, and making other subtle changes to our presentation.
