        <h2 class="centered text section-header">Popularity and Engagement</h2>

        <p class="body text">
          Social media is designed specifically to keep people engaged with content. When you click or scroll through
          your
          feed,
          you may think you're just seeing the same things as other people around you. As a recent Netflix documentary
          "The Social
          Dilemma" reveals, this could not be farther from the truth.</p>

        <p class="body text">
          Companies engage massive computer networks that learn what you like, what you don't like, what you're likely
          to
          like,
          and anything else that will keep your attention for longer. They can measure how long you look at an image,
          how
          long it
          took you to read a comment, whether you doubled back for a second glance, and a hundred other things that are
          fed into
          an AI computer model that probably knows you better than you know yourself.

        <h2 class="centered text section-header">Privacy Concerns</h2>

        <p class="body text">The usage of social media platforms may seem like a free service, but that
          couldn't
          be farther from the truth. Rather
          than paying with cash, people all across the globe give up their personal information to tech giants such as
          Meta,
          Twitter, Snap Inc., and ByteDance, to name a few. Primarily, Meta, previously Facebook, seems to be the
          driving
          force
          behind the changes in the current era of digital privacy. Few can remember a time when Facebook originally
          offered its
          users "simple and powerful controls over their personal information", as they've since changed their practices
          to drive
          their business and make money from advertising.
